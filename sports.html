            Harry Kane suffered a late injury after scoring twice to rescue a
            point for Tottenham against Everton at Goodison Park.

          <p>
            Nine days before the Carabao Cup final and 58 days before England's
            European Championship opener, Kane limped off in stoppage time with
            an apparent ankle problem.<br />
            The striker seemed to land awkwardly after jumping for a header when
            defending a corner late on.<br />
            Manager Jose Mourinho said he did not know how serious the injury
            was.<br />
            "That's also a question I want an answer to as soon as possible but
            it's too early," Mourinho said.<br />
            "For him to come out it is not because it's nothing, it's something.
            <br />
            "We all felt the same fears of something that stops him playing
            Wednesday [against Southampton in the Premier League] and especially
            Sunday [the Carabao Cup final] but we will see." <br />
            Kane had earlier been at his clinical best, capitalising on two
            mistakes in the Everton defence to put Spurs ahead in the first half
            and grab a second-half equaliser. <br />
            In between Kane's strikes Gylfi Sigurdsson levelled from the penalty
            spot and gave Everton the lead by finishing off a fine team goal.
            <br />
            Everton pushed hardest for a winner and had the best chance to win
            it but Joshua King's effort was saved by Hugo Lloris and Richarlison
            fired the rebound over from 12 yards. <br />
            A draw suited neither side's pursuit of European football, with
            Tottenham staying seventh, five points behind fourth-placed West Ham
            and Everton a point and a place worse off, though they do have a
            game in hand. <br />
