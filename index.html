              Instagram has apologised after a mistake with its algorithm
              promoted diet content to users with eating disorders.

              The search function in the app automatically recommended terms
              including “appetite suppressants” and “fasting” to some people.
              <br />Eating disorder campaigners told the BBC that vulnerable
              people could be triggered and even relapse.<br />
              The social media platform said harmful terms have now been
              removed.<br />
              A spokesman for Facebook, which owns Instagram, told the BBC it
              was a “mistake” and the issue was resolved on Monday.<br />
              “We recently rolled out a new search functionality on Instagram
              beyond hashtags and usernames, to help you more easily discover
              and explore content you’re most interested in,” he added.<br />
              “As part of this new feature, when you tap on the search bar,
              we’ll suggest topics you may want to search for.<br />
              “Those suggestions, as well as the search results themselves, are
              limited to general interests, and weight loss should not have been
              one of them."

            As cruises are finally starting to hit the high seas after a
            difficult year filled with cancellations and question marks, many
            are requiring proof of vaccination against COVID-19 to board.

          <p>
            Notre-Dame Cathedral, one of the most iconic landmarks of the French
            capital, looks peaceful today: the new scaffolding and building
            cranes that surround it give Parisians and millions around the world
            cause to celebrate the renewal of the more than 850-year-old
            monument.
